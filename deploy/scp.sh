# This is a very simple deployment script to move certificates to a remote
# server. The deployment uses scp (the remote cp method of ssh) and simply
# drops certs into a target directory. Targets have the original scp format
# e.g. like:
#
#   server.com:/var/spool/acme.sh/certs/
#   user@server.com:/var/spool/acme.sh/certs/
#   configuredserver:/var/spool/acme.sh/certs/
#
# You may use something like "configuredserver" which is the name of a host
# configuration in the ~/.ssh/config file. If you have a more complex setup
# like different ports, identity files, users or hostnames you are strongly
# encouraged to use an entry in your ~/.ssh/config file. This saves this
# little script from reimplementing every possible scp switch.
#
# You might wanto to configure ssh on the target server to use a special
# account with key based authentication and allow scp only. Have a further
# look at the rssh shell to allow scp only. You might as well put the user
# into a chroot.
#
# The main reason for this form of deployment is, that the acme.sh script
# can run in a safe and controlled environment. The acme.sh script needs
# detailed and sensitive information e.g. like your acme private keys or
# your dns providers credentials. Information like this you certainly don't
# want to have lying around on your public webserver.
#
# Further deployment of the certificates should be handled by a cron job on
# the remote server. That remote script could then move the new cert's to
# their proper position, set file owner and permissions and restart the
# belonging service.
#
# An example script for apache (on debian systems) might be:
#
#    #!/usr/bin/env sh
#    chown root:root /var/spool/acme.sh/certs/*
#    mv /var/spool/acme.sh/certs/* /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/
#    systemctl restart apache2
#
# To avoid misunderstandings, this script is NOT like other deployment
# scripts that target a specific type of server (apache/cyrus/exim/...)
# and do all ssl configuration for you. With this script YOU do all your
# ssl configuration on your target server yourself. Then, and only after
# the target server is properly configured, you use this script to deploy
# the forthcoming LE certificates.

# When called for the first time use the following env vars to setup the
# configuration. The vars will be stored on a per domain basis.
#DEPLOY_SCP_CA_TARGET="user@server.com:/etc/apache2/ssl.crt"
#DEPLOY_SCP_KEY_TARGET="user@server.com:/etc/apache2/ssl.key"
#DEPLOY_SCP_CERT_TARGET="user@server.com:/etc/apache2/ssl.crt"
#DEPLOY_SCP_FULLCHAIN_TARGET="user@server.com:/etc/apache2/ssl.crt"
